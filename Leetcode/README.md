# Leetcode
Time to learn some algorithms and data structures. Below are the questions I've
been doing in order.

## Questions to redo
These are a few I didn't get the fastest times on, might redo later.
- (3) Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- (1) Two Sum

## To study
These questions had specific algorithms I probably had to Google for, good to review.
- (50) pow(x, n)
